## Overview

This repository is an exhibition of a professional README generator. I was tasked with creating a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) package.

## Why Professional README Guides Are Important

When creating an open-source project on GitHub, a high-quality README is important to reveal essential information about the repo's project whilst being an important part of a developer's public identity in their chosen profession. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributionsâ€”this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.
